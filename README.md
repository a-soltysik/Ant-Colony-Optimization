An implementation of ant colony optimization algorithm.

## How to use it?  

#### **"in"** directory and input files

In the **"in"** directory you have to create input files. Each need to have the same structure as **"in_template.ant"**. Each file have to be named **"in\<x>"**, where **"\<x>"** is the number of an experiment starting from **1**.

#### **"out" directory and output files

The **"out"** directory will be created automaticaly as soon as the first launch of the program takes place. The name of each program will be **"out\<x>"**, where **"\<x>"** is the number of an experiment starting from **1**.
